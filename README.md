# Minesweeper Game - C++ (Windows Console)

## Overview

This is a console-based implementation of the classic *Minesweeper* game, written in C++ for Windows. The game consists of a grid of hidden cells, with some of them containing mines. The objective is to uncover all the cells without triggering any mines. The game provides an interface for users to interact with the grid, flag cells suspected to contain mines, and reveal non-mined cells.

## Features

- **Randomized Mines**: Mines are randomly placed on the grid at the start of each game.
- **Grid Display**: The game displays a grid showing the current state of uncovered cells.
- **Flagging**: Players can flag cells to mark suspected mines.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the player uncovers a mine or successfully reveals all safe cells.
- **Console-based**: Runs in the Windows command line (console).
  
### User Input: 
#### In Menu:
- **Z / S / Space Bar**: Used to navigate through the menu options.

#### In Game:
- Use the console to interact with the game grid by inputting commands to uncover or flag cells.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, MSVC) for Windows.
- **Windows Operating System** to run the console application.
